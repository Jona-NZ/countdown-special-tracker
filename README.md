### Usage

1. Update the ```url``` variable with the product you wish to monitor and run the file with ```py cst.py```

How you wish to utilise the script is up to you; either host it locally/remotely and run it on a schedule, or incorporate it into a web app.

### Requirements

1. After cloning the repo, import the required modules using:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Ensure you have a `.env` file in the root directory prior to running the script:
```
EMAIL_USER = login_email_for_sending_account
EMAIL_PASS = login_password_for_sending_account
TO_EMAIL = receiving_email_address
```
3. Update the SMTP information in the ```email()``` method. If using Gmail, you must grant less secure apps access to your account under your Google account settings.

4. Download and install the relevant chromedriver.exe and place it into the root folder.
